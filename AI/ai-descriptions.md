# AI-generated Descriptions

This feature uses artificial intelligence to automatically generate detailed, two-paragraph descriptions of images and graphics. Users can provide their own prompts to the AI, asking it to describe specific aspects of the images and request shorter or longer descriptions.
This provides valuable extra data to help find the images.

## How it works
In the main gallery, select one or more images and press the Describe Images button.  There will be an option to modify the default prompt the AI uses to describe the images.

<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><img style="border: 1px solid grey;" width="100%" src="https://cdn.dbgallery.cloud/Download.aspx?id=411513&public=2/ai-descriptions-2&1273070938" alt="AI descriptions main menu button"/></p>

That default prompt is set by a system administrator, and should look something like the following:
<p style="margin-left: 5%;">“Describe the image in 2 paragraphs.  If there are people, describe them.  If there is architecture, name the style and architect name if known.  If a significant portion of the image is of flowers, provide the flower name when possible.”</p>

## An Example:
Here the default prompt above was used to describe an iconic Qatar building.

<p><img style="border: 1px solid grey;" width="100%" src="https://cdn.dbgallery.cloud/Download.aspx?id=411514&public=2/ai-descriptions-example-1&999069643" alt="AI descriptions example"/></p>


## Defining the AI Prompt
While the default prompt is available to administrators under Tools | Preferences, when pressing the above mentioned Describe Images button a text area is shown where the default can be changed to something appropriate to the images being currently described.
