# AI for Video

<p>DBGallery uses AI-powered video analysis, enabling you to maximize the value of your video assets. This increases asset discoverability and reduces manual data entry.</p>

## Usage
<strong>AI video analysis does not run automatically on upload.</strong> To begin AI video analysis, select one or more videos and click the <em>Video Analysis</em> button in the gallery view's main menu.

## Important Notes
<ul>
<li>AI Video Analysis may not yet be available in your DBGallery instance.</li>
<li><strong>Time to process: </strong>It can take 2 minutes or greater per video to process, depending on the video size.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum Size: </strong>The maximum video file size is 2GB.</li>
<li>How many at once: Up to 200 videos at a time has been tested.  We recommend starting with 1 to 10 at a time when starting to use this new feature, moving to more once successful.</li>
<li><strong>Cost: </strong>This feature is offered at no additional cost until at least <strong>March 2026</strong>. Beyond this date, usage-based pricing may apply.</li>
<li>Some videos may be rejected as harmful by the AI.  This is a restriction of the Microsoft Azure AI Video Indexer service used by DBGallery.  This will often happen with photos of injured animals, for example.  The AI Description data field will show a message when this occurs.</li>
