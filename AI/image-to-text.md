# Image-to-text (OCR)

Any text in a photo can be read and stored as part of the data associated with that photo.  This can include:
-	Company logoâ€™s
-	Business cards
-	Street signs
-	Handwritten text
-	Photos of full page documents

Up to 64k of text can be read and stored.

The text read is editable within DBGallery. 
NOTE: While the read text is editable, sending a photo for text recognition subsequent times will override edits.

This text is, of course, used when searching for images across DBGallery.
