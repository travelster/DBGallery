# Grid View: Excel-like Data Entry Grid

<p>
The data grid view allows spreadsheet-like data entry as well as a quick look at the data which exists for images in a search result.
It's a great way to get an overview of existing data, and a surprisingly convenient way to enter data in some scenarios.
<br />
<br />
It has following features:
<br />
<ul>
    <li>Edit image fields (appropriate permissions are required).  Supports fast data entry: Enter data into a cell and press enter or an arrow key to move to the next cell to start entering data again.</li>
    <li>Excel spreadsheet-like navigation with arrow keys to move around the grid.</li>
    <li>Sort by column values by clicking the header.</li>
    <li>Choose which columns are shown.</li>
    <li>Change column order by moving headers horizontally.</li>
</ul>
</p>
