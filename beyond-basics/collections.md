# Collections

Collections are a fast and convenient way to build collections of photos. Gathering images for an upcoming ad campaign, for example, and placing them in a Collection.  They are sets of images you create via drag and drop which are zero-space pointers back to original images.  If you're familiar with Windows, a file shortcut is a close analogy, or for Mac users they're like Aliases.  This avoids the need to copy or move images to create collections. They're a great way to create permanent or temporary collections and projects. Some clients rename the feature to Projects, Light Boxes, Collections and other names to be more beneficial to their organization.
