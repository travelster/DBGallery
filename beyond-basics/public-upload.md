# Public Uploads

A folder can be configured to allow anyone with the created link to upload images.  Essentially, simply press the 3 dots next to a folder, choose a few options, and then sent to created link to those who will upload images.  A few key points:
- No login is required.  
- Images already existing in the folder cannot be seen by those opening the link.
- Nothing can be done within the folder by those opening the link except upload files.
- The link can be disabled or removed completely from DBGallery's Share Management page.
