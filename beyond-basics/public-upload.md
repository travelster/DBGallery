# Public Uploads

A folder can be configured to allow anyone with a created link to upload images.  Essentially, simply press the 3 dots next to a folder, choose a few options, and then sent the created link to those who will upload images.  A few key points:
- No login is required.  
- Images already existing in the folder cannot be seen by those opening the link.
- Nothing can be done within the folder by those opening the link except upload files.
- The link can be disabled or removed completely from DBGallery's Share Management page.

## Creating the Public Upload Link
There are 3 steps
1. Select the 3 dots to the right of the folder where files will be uploaded.
2. Choose configuration options.
3. Send the public upload link to those who will perform the uploads.

### 1. Select the folder
Any folder may be chosen for configuring an upload.  Typically one would start with an empty folder.  As in the screenshot below, folders where uploads occur may be under a parent folder, where the sub-folders are shared with specific individuals or groups.

### 3. Share the link

## FAQs
Q: Can uploads be to a Collection?
A: Collections can never have files uploaded to directly, whether it be public uploads or internally by those logged in.  Collections hold pointers to the original file location in a folder. Hence uploads only ever occur to a folder. 

Q: Can a shared folder link be protected by a password?
A: If password protection is required, create a user within DBGallery and provide upload permissions to any specific folder for that user.
