# Drag and Drop Folder and File Operations

Files and Folders may be dragged and dropped much like Windows Explorer (Windows) or File Finder (Mac).  The can be created, renamed, etc.
Drag files from the thumbs view to the folder tree (or the Collections tree if using that excellent feature). Folders can also be dragged and dropped within the folders tree.
Below is a sample of a number of files being dragged to the folders tree.

You may create, rename and delete files and folders, as well as Collections. Find those operations by clicking the 3 dots to the right of their name, as shown below.
