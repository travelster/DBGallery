# Importing Data

DBGallery allows for metadata import via a csv file during upload.  This is accomplished by uploading a zip file that contains the image files and a corresponding csv file holding the metadata.  If the images already exist, the zip file may contain just the csv file.

For full details see our <a href="https://dbgallery.com/download/DBGalleryDataImportGuide.pdf">Data Import Guide</a> (PDF).
