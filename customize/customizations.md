# UI and Functionality Customizations

Customizations to both the UI and system capabilities are available at a cost.  This is most often requested for 2 reasons:

- Companies seeking the right Digital Asset Management system and DBGallery is their best option but is missing one or two features.  E.g. DBGallery meets 28 of their 30 items on their requirements checklist, which is the highest of others investigated.  Adding those 2 items makes it perfect and even with the cost of those customizations (our rates are excellent), the cost is lower than other DAM systems investigated.

- An existing client has been using DBGallery for some time, to great success, but there is a feature that would be very useful for their users.  Usually the convenience and time save pays for the customization cost.
