# Custom Fields

Custom fields extend search capabilities by defining data fields specific to their industry or organization. The system can feel more natural and easier to use.  

They are used for data entry, their data is included in all searches, and you choose where this data is shown on various pages across DBGallery.  Where it can be displayed include data shown when images are shared, what is shown under or above thumbs, and the Info tab when viewing an image.  By default they appear only in the Full Data tab when previewing an image.
