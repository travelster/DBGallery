# Uploading

Uploading always starts by selecting a folder to upload images to.  The folder tree is shown on the left side.  If it is not shown, press the three menu lines in the very top left corner:

<p style="margin-left: 15%;"><img style="border: 1px solid purple;" width="50%" src="/assets/Upload-FolderTree.gif" alt="Uploading Drag and Drop Files"/></p>

Add files by dragging and dropping them onto the Upload window.  Alternatively, press Add files then select any number of file and press enter.  Shown immediately below, and example addition of files by dropping files onto the upload window from Windows Explorer.

**Note:** Entire folders may be added.  Any sub-folders and their images will be included.  The folder structure will be reflected within DBGallery.

Be sure to select Automatically Recognize Objects and Duplicates Detection if appropriate (they usually are). Recognizing objects will automatically tag common items found in photos.

## During Upload
While uploading, data details of the images or just thumbs may be shown.  If details are shown, recognized objects may be shown as well as address info for images which have GPS coordinates:

Press the Show/Hide Details button to toggle between details and just thumbs:

## Seeing it in action
Notice how the Events folder is chosen on the left, and how the Show/Hide Details button changes what is shown about each file being uploaded.

Upon upload completion, choose one of three options:
- ***Return to folder:*** The simplist option, returning to showing the images in the folder.
- ***Edit:*** This allows metadata editing of all images just uploaded.
- ***Resolve duplicates:*** Shown only when 'Duplicates detention' is checked and there are duplicates.

## Showing images just uploaded.
After returning to the folder, knowing which images where just uploaded isn't always obvious.  Have them rise to the top by choosing the sort by Added to DBG, and Desc.  (Added to DBG = Added to DBGallery)
