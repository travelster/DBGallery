# Related Images

Select a photo and DBGallery can show related photos in a sidebar.  To get to that sidebar, press the button shown in the sreenshot below near the top right.  An image must be selected or the sidebar won't appear.

Please note: Not all DBGallery systems have this feature enabled.  Contact your DBGallery administrator, or DBGallery support, to have this turned on.  There is no additional cost.

<p style="padding-left: 5%;"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Related images button and sidebar.</p>

There are the categories of related images:

1) **Visually similar:** Uses an algorithm to show images that have similar colors and contrast.

2) **Similar time:** Shows images with a Date Taken within 5 minutes before and after the selected photo.

3) **Similar Objects:** Expermental: Finds photos that have an object recognition keyword that matches the selected image's first object recognition keyword. [This is an experimental early release and a future release will show those most similar to all the selected photo's keywords.]

Where it looks for related images: The current folder and all sub-folders.  If in a Collection, it searches the entire system.

Each category will show a maximum of 28 images.

This feature works for photo formats only.

Photos in the sidebar can be dragged and dropped onto a Folder (a move) or a Collection (added there).  

Photos can be opened from there by clicking the view button which appears of the photo.
