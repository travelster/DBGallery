# Sharing

Sharing is simple and secure, with no login required.

## Selecting Images to Share 
To share images select any number of thumbs and press the Share images button.

## Share Settings
Copy the URL by pressing Ok, or the Copy to clipboard button to the right of the link, then drop it into an email, chat message, a document, or anywhere else.

Share links do not require a login.  They are secure in that to view the images in the share the full long and complex link would have to be guessed.

Shared images are viewed directly from their location within DBGallery, not a copy placed somewhere.  If the image’s data is updated the new data will be seen when the share link is opened.  As well, if an image is deleted it will no longer show when the share link is opened.  Those that will exist will, of course, so delete one image doesn’t break the share link entirely.

## Unfurling

Share links will unfurl when dropped onto most social media apps.  In the animated example to the left, Slack unfurls the link to flip through thumbs of the images being shared.

When the link is clicked the following would appear.
