# Action Notifications

Specific events within DBGallery can trigger notification emails to make users aware of changes within the system.  

Examples:
- Workflow changes: subscribe to receive a notification when an image’s status changes from ‘Awaiting approval’ to ‘Requires modification’.
- Be notified when a share link you created is opened by a client or colleague.
- When everything that happens inside a special folder is important to you, choose to receive an email when images are added, deleted or their data is modified.
