# Activity Monitoring

DBGallery's audit trail, aka activity monitoring, capabilities of the system is found on two pages:

1. **The audit log page.**  Access this through the main menu's Tools / Audit trail.
2. **Versions tab of in image preview.**  This displays all image changes as well as metadata changes (also considered a version in DBGallery).
3. **Dashboard.**  A less detailed view providing a quick overvew of recent activity.
4. **Sort by.** Provides a full look at all images reently viewed, updated and added.

1. The audit log page.

An audit trail for a specific user.  It's not spying, it's about having to ability to see into events of the system.  Most indicate this is most often used for reviewing the log of what you yourself has done.

2. <b>The Versions tab of image preview: An audit trail for a specific image.</b>
<br/>
Audit events of a specific image is critical when data has been mismanaged.  When one image is being collaborated on by an entire team knowing the history of who has done what provides great comfort knowing a full history is available.  This can be a major advantage of digital asset management systems, and one sorely missing from standard file management systems where multi-user logs are generally not kept.
