# Activity Monitoring

Understand what your image collection users are doing within the system by using our activity trail log. When someone uploads, edit, deletes or opens a share link, amount others, there is a log entry. Within the log page, filters can be set for the specific type of change (upload, delete, etc.) and the user name by just typing any portion of a user name.
